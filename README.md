# Quiz-Maker
A Python program that allows teachers to set multiple choice questions and allows students to take the quiz and get scored.
I'm proud to present a Python Quiz Maker & Grader I built. This interactive project allows users to take a quiz on Python basics, see their scores, and even add questions!
